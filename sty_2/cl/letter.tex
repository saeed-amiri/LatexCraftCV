Dear Hiring Team,\\

With extensive experience in HPC‑based simulation (6+ years), a strong analytical background (Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics), and newly formalized skills in data science and MLOps, I am ready to contribute to research projects that demand both scientific depth and modern computational engineering.\\

My doctoral research at the University of Göttingen relied heavily on molecular dynamics simulations using LAMMPS, complemented by self‑developed C and Python code—often parallelized—executed on the GWDG HPC systems. In this work, I developed efficient workflows for running, monitoring, and validating large numbers of simulations. During my postdoctoral research, I continued this trajectory with significantly more complex and extended biophysical systems (GROMACS, LAMMPS, Python, Bash) on the HLRN supercomputing infrastructure, conducting extensive simulations and managing sophisticated computational pipelines across distributed environments.\\

Working with large and heterogeneous datasets, evolving model versions, and repeated simulation cycles highlighted the importance of reproducibility, data lineage, and structured workflows. Although I was able to build acceptable pipelines in Bash and Python, these challenges motivated me to pursue formal training in data science and MLOps through a Sorbonne‑certified program. This training strengthened my ability to design complete, end‑to‑end pipelines—from data ingestion and preprocessing to analysis, machine‑learning workflows, API integration, security layers, and monitoring. I gained hands‑on experience with modern tools for versioning not only code but also data and models (DVC, Dagshub), as well as containerization and cloud‑ready deployment using Docker and cloud fundamentals. Furthermore, I gained practical experience with ML model versioning (MLflow), workflow orchestration (Airflow), microservice management (NGINX), and system‑level monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus). These skills complement my HPC background and enable me to build scalable, reproducible, and maintainable computational systems.\\

With this combined experience, I can contribute effectively in three key areas aligned with the responsibilities of this role:\\

\vspace{-0.5em}
(1) \textbf{High‑performance and large‑scale computation:} First‑hand experience with GWDG and HLRN HPC environments, including job scheduling, performance optimization, debugging, and supporting colleagues in designing efficient simulation workflows.\\

\vspace{-0.5em}
(2) \textbf{Data‑driven engineering and reproducible pipelines:} Development of structured, version‑controlled workflows using DVC, Dagshub, Docker, and modern MLOps practices to ensure traceability, reproducibility, and maintainability across the entire computational lifecycle.\\

\vspace{-0.5em}
(3) \textbf{Robust analysis, modeling, and technical communication:} Strong analytical skills from years of simulation and modeling work, combined with the ability to document results clearly and communicate technical insights to interdisciplinary teams.\\

I am motivated to bring this blend of scientific rigor, HPC experience, and modern data‑engineering and MLOps skills to a role where scalable computation, reliable pipelines, and analytical depth are essential. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can support your team’s technical and scientific goals.\\

Kind regards,\
